Face Recognition is a well researched problem and is widely used in both industry and in academia. As an example, a criminal in China was caught because a Face Recognition system in a mall detected his face and raised an alarm. Clearly, Face Recognition can be used to mitigate crime. There are many other interesting use cases of Face Recognition:<br><br></p>
<p><ul>
    <li> Facial Authentication: Apple has brought in Face ID for Facial Authentication in iPhones. Some of the leading banks are trying to use Facial Authentication for lockers.<br>
    <li> Customer Service: Some of the banks in Malaysia have installed systems which use Face Recognition to detect valuable customers of the bank so that the bank can provide the personalized service. This way, banks are able to generate more revenues by retaining such customers and keeping them happy.<br>
    <li> Insurance Underwriting: Many insurance companies are using Face Recognition to match the face of the person with that provided in the photo ID proof. This way, the underwriting process becomes much faster.
